As the guardian of quality, the software quality assurance role is key in identifying sources of team tensions and diffusing them before they escalate. Though their main task is ensuring product excellence, QA must also monitor team dynamics for brewing discontent. With the right conflict resolution tactics, QA can preemptively resolve tensions through open communication, fairness, and promoting shared goals. This article provides a short overview of how software QA can recognize and mitigate team conflicts to enable collaborative software excellence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conflict-root-cause-identification-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conflict-root-cause-identification-\" aria-label=\"conflict root cause identification  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conflict root cause identification üê£</h2>\n<p>Below you will read about five examples of conflicts that may commonly occur between the software development team and the quality assurance team. Their probability may vary depending on the organization and project:</p>\n<p>Main source of conflicts: Communication and Collaboration\nInadequate communication and collaboration between the development and quality assurance teams can lead to conflicts. Lack of clear requirements, documentation, or frequent miscommunication can result in misunderstandings, delays, and disagreements on the expected functionality or testing approach. Collaborative efforts and effective communication channels are crucial to avoid conflicts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Requirement Ambiguity:\nDifferent interpretation of requirements: this can result in misunderstandings, delays, and rework if the two teams have different understandings of what needs to be built or tested.</li>\n<li>Time Constraints:\nTight project timelines: developers may feel pressured to release features quickly, while QA specialists require sufficient time to thoroughly test the software. Balancing these competing priorities can cause friction and compromises that may impact software quality.</li>\n<li>Defect Resolution:\nDifferences in prioritization and severity assessments of defects (bugs) can create conflicts. The quality assurance team might consider a bug critical and request immediate resolution, while the development team may not prioritize it similarly due to other pending tasks or conflicting priorities. This can lead to disagreements and delays in bug fixes.</li>\n<li>Scope Creep:\nScope creep refers to the continuous expansion of project requirements beyond the initially defined scope. When new features or changes are introduced without proper communication or assessment, conflicts can arise between the development and quality assurance teams. QA may lack sufficient time or resources to test the additional functionality adequately, leading to concerns about product quality.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"resolving-conflict-situations---qa-perspective-üßê\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#resolving-conflict-situations---qa-perspective-%F0%9F%A7%90\" aria-label=\"resolving conflict situations   qa perspective üßê permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Resolving conflict situations - QA perspective üßê</h2>\n<p>Being aware and even better identifying problems early is crucial - but even so conflict situations happen and resolving them requires proactive solutions from QA roles as well. An impactful approach is holding face-to-face workshops focused on aligning values, responsibilities, and plans across all team members. Facilitating open and non-judgmental dialogue through team-building exercises can foster empathetic understanding and pave the way for collaborative conflict resolution.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs imagine a situation where a bug was found on within a product that had a great impact on it - tension is high to mitigate the conflict given situation and to prevent similar situations in the future, we can approach a conflict situation using the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stay Calm and Objective:\nAs a software quality assurance specialist, it‚Äôs important to approach the situation with a calm and objective mindset. Avoid assigning blame and focus on resolving the issue and improving the overall process.</li>\n<li>Investigate the Bug:\nConduct a thorough investigation of the bug and gather all relevant information. This includes understanding the steps to reproduce the issue, analyzing the impact on users, and determining the root cause of the bug. Collect relevant data, including information on the testing activities performed, test coverage, and any potential areas that might have been missed.</li>\n<li>Communicate Openly:\nInitiate a discussion with the developer to understand their perspective and concerns regarding the bug. Encourage open and respectful communication, allowing both sides to express their viewpoints without becoming defensive or accusatory.</li>\n<li>Analyze the Testing Process:\nReview the testing process and procedures that were followed during the QA phase. Assess whether the bug could have been reasonably expected to be detected during testing. Look for any gaps or areas of improvement in the testing strategy, test coverage, or test environment setup.</li>\n<li>Identify Process Enhancements and implement Corrective Actions:\nBased on the investigation and analysis, identify any process enhancements that can help prevent similar situations in the future. This could include improvements to the testing methodologies, test case coverage, test environment setup, or collaboration between developers and QA include enhancing test cases, refining test strategies, increasing test coverage, improving communication channels, or adjusting the overall development process.</li>\n<li>Communicate the Actions:\nTransparently communicate the identified process improvements and the actions to be taken to all stakeholders involved. Clearly explain the rationale behind these improvements and how they will contribute to preventing similar bugs in the future. This helps ensure everyone is aligned and committed to the proposed changes.</li>\n<li>Promote a Learning Culture:\nEmphasize the importance of a learning culture within the organization. Encourage both developers and QA specialists to share their knowledge and insights, promote knowledge transfer sessions, and conduct post-mortem meetings or retrospectives to learn from past experiences.</li>\n<li>Continuous Monitoring and Iterative Improvements:\nRegularly monitor the effectiveness of the implemented process improvements and track the bug detection rate in subsequent releases. Engage in regular feedback loops with all stakeholders to gather insights and identify areas for further enhancement. Foster a culture of continuous improvement by consistently reviewing and refining the testing and development processes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From this article addresses the issue how software developers and QA people can bump heads over things like unclear requirements, tight deadlines, and disagreements about bug severity. QA plays a big role in spotting and defusing problems early before things blow up. When bugs do slip through, QA should stay calm, investigate thoroughly, and have open and non-blamey conversations with devs to get their side. Look at how testing could improve, like enhancing test cases and coverage. Implement changes to prevent future bugs, and keep monitoring to spot new areas to refine. The main idea is to keep communicating, learn from mistakes, and work together - not battle each other.</p>\n<p>Sources/ Further reading: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/conflict-resolution-skills\">27 Conflict Resolution Skills to Use with Your Team and Your Customers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220421579_Managing_Conflict_in_Software_Testing_Lessons_from_the_Field\">Managing Conflict in Software Testing: Lessons from the Field</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agileconnection.com/article/5-ways-testers-can-mitigate-practical-risks-agile-team\">5 Ways Testers Can Mitigate Practical Risks in an Agile Team</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.pl/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576/ref=asc_df_0141033576/?tag=plshogostdde-21&#x26;linkCode=df0&#x26;hvadid=504298723827&#x26;hvpos=&#x26;hvnetw=g&#x26;hvrand=7600623230080830277&#x26;hvpone=&#x26;hvptwo=&#x26;hvqmt=&#x26;hvdev=c&#x26;hvdvcmdl=&#x26;hvlocint=&#x26;hvlocphy=20848&#x26;hvtargid=pla-394582189334&#x26;psc=1\">Thinking, Fast and Slow: Daniel Kahneman</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/how-to-overcommunicate-effectively?utm_source=pocket_saves\">How to overcommunicate effectively</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_to_Yes\">Getting to Yes</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"üß® A short introduction to software quality assurance role in team conflicts ü§∫","date":" 08/07/2023","tags":["conflict","conflict resolution","communication","quality assurance"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/QA/team-project-conflicts/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/QA/risk-based-testing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"üßê Risk based testing"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/e2e/playwright-static-code-analysis/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"üé≠ Playwright: eslint + husky > guarding good practices with static pre-commit checks of static code"}}}}}
